Honor's Option Project for MSU CE221

This project uses vector algebra and moment concept to find an equivalent replacement wrench for a system of forces.  The IPython notebook shows the code used to both solve for the wrench and generate graphics to represent it.  

Graphics:
The points represented in each graphic show the connection points of the springs attached to add force to the system.  Points A-D are on the platform being suspended, while all other points are on the frame.
